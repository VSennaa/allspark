# If you need a newer pyadi-iio not published on PyPI, install from GitHub:
# pip install git+https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio

# Notes: `pyadi-iio` requires system libraries (libiio, device drivers, etc.)
# to talk to ADI devices (PlutoSDR). On Debian/Ubuntu you may need to install
# appropriate packages (example):
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install libiio-utils libiio-dev libad9361-dev
